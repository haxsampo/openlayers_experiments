# OpenLayers experiment

The purpose of this app is to experiment with OpenLayers. I want to do some basic stuff expected of GIS library: add layers, show them, choose layers and so on. 

I chose React as I found it interesting to see how the two libaries would fit together. 

# Instructions

1. Clone the repo 

2. Run `npm install` in the main folder
